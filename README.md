# Palmoria-Group-Dashboard-Analysis
I am pleased to submit the completed Palmoria Group HR Data Analytics Project. This analysis addresses critical organizational concerns, with a focus on gender equality, salary structure, performance ratings, and regulatory compliance across the company's three regional divisions.
The insights generated from the dataset are supported by a range of visualizations, KPIs, and data-driven recommendations, all presented in a clean, interactive Power BI dashboard. Data transformation steps were carefully implemented to ensure accuracy, including filtering out incomplete records and assigning generalized gender tags where necessary.
Please find the full Power BI report along with all supporting documentation. I am confident that this report will support executive decision-making and contribute meaningfully toward resolving the HR issues currently facing Palmoria Group.

Comprehensive HR Data Analysis for Palmoria Group, focused on gender equality, salary compliance, performance ratings, and bonus allocation. Built with Power BI and DAX. Includes data cleaning, transformation, KPI dashboards, and executive summary.
